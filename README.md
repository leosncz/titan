# Titan Engine

**Titan Engine** is a rendering engine (possibly also game engine in the future) which is small, lightweigth and easily customizable.

## Example
Shadow example :

PBR example :

## Actual supported features:
- Runs on Windows, Mac & Linux (32-64 bits)
- Infinite number of lights
- Directionnal, spot and point light supported
- Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
- Albedo map (up to 3 textures on a single object)
- Metallic map
- Roughness map
- Normal map
- Gamma correction
- HDR (customizable exposure)
- Dynamic shadows
- OBJ Model loader
- Automatic texture cache
- GUI

## Currently working on (top is prioritized) :
- AO map (priority)
- SSAO (priority)
- TitanScripting to enable users exporting their game using TitanEngine
- Defered shading
- Physics system
- Infinite number of shadows
- Dynamic light frustrum

## Build
In order to use & build the project with this library, you must install the following libraries :
- GLFW
- OpenGL
- GLEW
- GLM </br>
If you use the sln solution, keep in mind that everything is 64-bit oriented.
