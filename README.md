# Titan Engine
![logo](graphicData/logo.jpg "logo")

**Titan Engine** is a powerfull & lightweight game engine aimed to create minimalist 2D games as well as
big 3D open-worlds full of details. </br>
The final goal is to have a simple visual editor to easily build great games without the need to code, but the editor will support TitanScripting, an easy to understand language to interact with the world.

## Example
**Actual** GUI editor state:
